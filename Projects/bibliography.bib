These bounds are sharp in the sense that they match the recent probabilistic upper bounds for the star discrepancy of Latin hypercube samples proved in Gnewuch and Hebbinghaus (Discrepancy bounds for a class of negatively dependent random points including Latin hypercube samples. Preprint 2016). Together, this result and our work implies that the discrepancy of Latin hypercube samples differs at most by constant factors from the discrepancy of uniformly sampled point sets.},
